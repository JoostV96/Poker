GUI to play Poker with two players

How to play:
Player 1 starts off. He can place a bet by increasing the bet size. 
After confirming the bet by pressing "enter", the player has to press the space bar.
Then, his cards will be hidden and player 2 can take place. When he presses the space bar again, he will see his cards and the game progresses. 

`Poker.py` is the main program. It imports all functions from `HandEvaluator.py` which evaluates each hand. This is used to determine the winner of the pot.
